How to start the backend services

For this application I have used two technology stacks, one is for I/O heave tasks and
another one is for CPU heavy tasks.

To work with the I/O heavy tasks I have used Node JS and Express framework.
To work with the CPU heavy tasks I have used Spring Boot framework.

Start Node JS server
  1. Navigate to the "Backend" folder
  2. Then navigate to the "node-api" folder
  3. Run "npm install" to install the dependencies
  4. Run "npm run dev" to start the server
  5. Then server is start running on PORT 9098

Start Spring Boot server
  1. Navigate to the "Backend" folder
  1. Then navigate to the "spring-api" folder
  2. Go to the "SpringApiApplication.java" file inside the "src" folder
  3. Right click and run that Java file to start the spring server.
  4. Then server is start running on PORT 9097
